           Welcome to my puzzles. These may be frustrating or annoying. Some require knowledge of some computer science things, others require trivia. A few need you to have an image-editing software, such as GIMP.

           Remember to think laterally and look at ALL the information. There are sometimes clues in the website title, as well(honestly, there are always clues there...).

           You should also do some googling. A search engine may be your best friend in many scenarios.

           If you get really stuck or need help you can message me. Try your best!
